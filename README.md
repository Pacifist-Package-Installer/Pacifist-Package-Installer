Pacifist is a professional-grade utility designed for macOS that enables users to inspect, extract, and install individual files from a variety of software containers such as .pkg installers, .dmg disk images, .xip archives, and compressed .zip files. It is an essential tool for anyone who needs to access specific resources within an installer without going through the full installation process.

With Pacifist, you can recover missing or corrupted files, examine package contents for security or educational purposes, and even modify existing applications by replacing specific components. The application provides a clean, intuitive interface that displays detailed metadata, file permissions, and digital signatures for each item inside a package.

Pacifist is trusted by developers, IT professionals, and power users for its accuracy and ease of use. It runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs and is fully compatible with the latest versions of macOS.
